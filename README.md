# Self-Learning_IOT_Remainder Project

# Description
This project involved creating a system which sends remainders to the user whenever 
they missed a task. Amazon Web Service will be used with an IOT device to send emails or text messages to the user whenever a task is approaching or missed.

# Use Case
The IOT remainder is a general purpose remainder device where a user action need to be reminded based on a time schedule. The unique feature of this remainder system is that it has the algorithm to learn the activation schedule based on the usage.
The device record user events and sends the time stamp to the server. The device also has ability to recieve messages from the server.  The events are stored in a time series database. Both the server and the device has the algorithm to learn the event schedule based on the usage pattern.
